### DESCRIPTION

This folder contains the front end files of project number 5 of
the Openclassrooms web developer training course.

### TO RUN THIS PROJECT

. Open a new terminal.
. Go to backend folders.
. Start the server by entering the command: node server.js .
. The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`.
. If the server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

### GOAL

This is my first project in JavaScript language.
I used an API in order to present articles in order to build a pseudo E-commerce site.
This project show a unique theme of product : TEDDY BEAR!
But you can change theme if you call another API like : http://localhost:3000/api/cameras to show some cameras or
http://localhost:3000/api/furniture to show furnitures.
May options will not appear in page "produit.html" because is not the same key. So if you really
want to see it, you have to change this one in source code of "produit.js"

### thanks ...###

May you enjoy this project!
SEE YA!
